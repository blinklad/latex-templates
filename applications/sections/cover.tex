  {My name is Oriol Mirosa, and I’m writing to apply for a data scientist position at [Company].}

  {I’ve always been intrigued by data. In my academic work over the past 15 years, I’ve learned to ask tough questions and answer them with quantitative and qualitative data. I hold master’s degrees in business and development studies, as well as a Ph.D. in sociology, and I’ve received extensive training in statistics. I’ve performed statistical analyses and used visualization tools in my work to identify patterns and communicate my findings. Most recently, I employed structural equation modeling in a published paper to explore scientists' legitimacy and influence in climate change policy in the United States.}

  {I’m now embarking upon a second career as a data scientist, and would be thrilled to join the team at [Company]. In my research and development work around the world, I’ve witnessed first-hand the key role that funding for small businesses plays in providing opportunities and driving economic growth and innovation. Never has the power of data offered us such insights into the workings of our society and its economic and social processes. At [Company], I’d love to use my passion for data science and technology to help [customers] thrive.}

  {What can I offer [Company]? I’m experienced in programming languages such as Python and R, as well as the use of statistics and machine learning algorithms; I’m particularly excited about using machine learning for prediction. As a former academic, I have excellent analytical and problem-solving skills, and as an award-winning teacher, I’m a highly effective communicator. I’m also a native speaker of Spanish and Catalan. I believe these skills make me an ideal candidate: one who can easily grasp big-picture ideas as well as the detailed implementation of models and algorithms.}
