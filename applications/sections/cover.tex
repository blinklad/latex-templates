{My name is Evan Harvey, and Iâ€™m writing to apply for the 2020 Semester 1 PASS Leader position at the University of Tasmania, Newnham Campus. In particular, the units KIT101 and KIT107.}
\cvparagraph{}
{Beginning in 2017, I have achieved success as both a University student and a life-long learner. I began with the University Preparation Program (UPP) and fast-tracked into a Bachelors degree. I am now a second-year student with a 6.83 GPA, honour society invitee and hold a scholarship, with ambitions for post-graduate research. Importantly, however, is the broad view of life-long learning I have gained, including experience with the rich diversity and culture surrounding higher education at the University of Tasmania.}
\cvparagraph{}
{As identified by UTAS's Peer Leader Guidelines, engagement, belonging and integrated support are integral components for increasing student retention. I recognise the importance of promoting promoting both student and institutional interests in what are identified as key units. Both KIT101 and KIT107 represent a first-year treatment in fundamental programming concepts, and enrolment in this unit spans across faculties, pathways and educational areas.
	What I have to offer the PASS program is as follows:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item High marks in the 2020 PASS units I am applying for, KIT101 and KIT107, with 95\% and 83\% respectively, which shows competency in the units' outcomes;
		\item Experience in student diversity through my University College pathway;
		\item Intimately familiar with the structure, content and learning outcomes of KIT101 and KIT107, having discussed content with staff, or past students -- allowing effective integration of content and learning skills during sessions;
		\item Extremely thorough when planning and maintaining an area of responsibility, as demonstrated by my overall academic success;
		\item Strong communication skills and experience working in small to large groups, as part of prior work, study and my life experiences; and
		\item Experience in mentoring through study sessions with peers where I have enjoyed helping others
	\end{enumerate}
\cvparagraph{}
{I believe I am a highly suitable candidate for this position due to my achievements, strong personal and communication skills, life experiences and success within the units offered for PASS.
	My resume and selection criteria are included, and I look forward to discussing details of this position as details emerge.}
