  {What can I offer [Company]? I’m experienced in programming languages such as Python and R, as well as the use of statistics and machine learning algorithms; I’m particularly excited about using machine learning for prediction. As a former academic, I have excellent analytical and problem-solving skills, and as an award-winning teacher, I’m a highly effective communicator. I’m also a native speaker of Spanish and Catalan. I believe these skills make me an ideal candidate: one who can easily grasp big-picture ideas as well as the detailed implementation of models and algorithms.}
